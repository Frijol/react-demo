# Learning React

(Putting this on Github in case I need to find it again)

## Tutorials

created by following this excellent tutorial: <https://medium.freecodecamp.com/yes-react-is-taking-over-front-end-development-the-question-is-why-40837af8ab76>

helped by: <https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-use-es6-for-isomorphic-javascript-apps-2a9c3abe5ea2>

(tl;dr on that is that you should `npm i -g babel-cli` to get started using ES6 elements - which are in all the React tutorials - but do some further installations for anything you're sharing with others)

## What to do

`open index.html` to see it in your browser

Try typing something in the JS box while the timer is ticking vs. typing it in the React box.
